# Oni : D3D12 research renderer and playground

Oni is an experimental sandbox renderer written in C++ with D3D12. It's purpose is for it to be used as a portfolio piece once I go back to job finding.

## Requirements

- [xmake](https://xmake.io/#/)
- Windows SDK Latest
- Visual Studio 2022 + ATL Toolkit
- GPU with the following features:
    - DXR
    - Mesh shaders
    - Work graphs

## Building

- xmake
- Copy the contents of the bin folder in build/windows/x64/{debug/release}/
- Copy the D3D12 folder in build/windows/x64/{debug/release}/
- xmake run
- That's it!

## Features:

### Techniques

- Point lights
- Directional lights

- Forward shading
- Deferred rendering :
    - Depth Buffer R32Typeless
    - Normals RGBA16Float
    - Albedo + Emissive RGBA8Unorm
    - PBR + AO RGBA8Unorm

- PBR lighting and materials

- Environment mapping
- IBL

- Shadow mapping (directional)

### Post Processing
- Color grading
- Tonemapping
- Physically Based Bloom

### Misc
- Resource inspector
- VRAM/RAM/Battery usage UI
- Screenshot system
- Mipmap generation through compute
- Simple scene editor to add/move lights around
- Debug renderer (lines)
- Log window
- Shader hot reloading
- Texture compression (can be generated, not loaded in engine yet)

## WIP

- Motion blur
